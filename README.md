Welcome to my Repository!
I created this Repository for all the beginers who are out there trying to learn Java Programming
You might Say, why make it public , there are zillions of other youtubers that can teach me all this, Right?
When I was creating this Repository i was still learnnig Java , So I thought may be those youtubers missed or forgot mentioning small detail
that's where thiss Repository comes in handy!
   With Programmes that will help you build logic , and special notes in each programs that will help you become a good Java Programmer
I hope this will help you !
and also I am kinda new to using github so if i made some minor mistakes just ignore them , I am a human After all!
